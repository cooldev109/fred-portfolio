TruConnect is a unique SaaS platform that simplifies the management of gyms while also offering fitness and wellbeing 
content for users.
 This popular sports app is a revamp after acquisition based on an app developed by NERDZ LAB.

The web platform integrates with a mobile app and provides a centralized access point for running 
gym chains (coach management, training schedules, and user subscriptions).
 It also incorporates social media application features like post sharing, global leaderboards, 
and a robust exercise database to help users remain motivated in their fitness journey.
